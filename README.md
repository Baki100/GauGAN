# GauGAN

This repository contains the implementation and training of GauGAN, a cutting-edge model for synthesizing high-resolution images from semantic label maps. The model leverages a unique denormalization technique to achieve impressive results in multi-modal image synthesis.

## 🎯 Goals
- 📝 Understand the principles behind GauGAN.
- 🖼️ Implement the GauGAN model.
- 📈 Train the model using high-resolution images and semantic label maps.
- 🌐 Explore the spatially adaptive denormalization technique.
- 🎲 Experiment with random noise vectors to control image diversity.

## 📚 Background
GauGAN enhances the capabilities of Pix2PixHD by simplifying the network architecture and incorporating spatially adaptive denormalization layers. This improvement allows GauGAN to excel in multi-modal synthesis tasks by learning denormalization parameters through convolution of instance segmentation maps. The model's ability to use random noise vectors makes it highly versatile for generating diverse images.
